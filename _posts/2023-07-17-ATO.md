# Hello everyone, for my first blog in this blog, I will explain How can I Account-Take-Over-any-Account .

*While I do Subdomain Enumeration I looked at Sub Domain it was interesting It was Like This { app.dev.Target.com } So The Subdomains It was a copy of the original site
So Now After I finish Subdomains Enumeration I Start to browse The Subdomains one By one And try all The functions to understand The Target
So While I Browse The Main Domain I looked at the login Function The registration method was by number only , So I entered my number the verification was OTP 4 Digit !
I was surprised when the first thing that came to my mind was the brute force of the number But unfortunately They Have A Rate Limit*

**So I Start To Find a Method To Bypass It**

I Try To Changing IP origin using headers :

    X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1
    X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
    X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1
    X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1
    X-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1
    X-Host: 127.0.0.1
    X-Forwared-Host: 127.0.0.1

**Unfortunately, it didn't work**

*And I tried a lot of other ways to bypass it*

**Also, unfortunately, it didn't work**

**So I said let me move on To Other Functions
But I remembered The interesting Sub domain {app.dev.Target.com} Why don’t I try it To Brute Force The OTP ?
I tried but unfortunately it Have A Rate Limit**

> But I Said Why Not To Try To Bypass This Also ? 

**So I try To Changing IP origin using headers**

    X-Forwarded-For:

**Guess What ?** 

***it worked!, I succeeded To Bypass The Rate Limit***
